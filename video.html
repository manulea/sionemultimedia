<h2>Prologue</h2>

<p>Starting shots of nice sunny day with Va’a ( Sione ), ‘pretending to talk with his friends’ as he goes back inside, away from the hot outdoors.<br><br>

He opens the door, closes the door, while the camera follows him on his way to the computer.<br><br>

He gets to the computer, and realizes.. Hey, I have an assignment due tomorrow!<br><br>

[ This idea of having the assignment due tomorrow, is the basis of the Life Hack video ! ]<br><br>

While reading out multiple life hacks from the internet, a thought process in the form of an action-replay, plays out in an almost (second reality) sort of thing, where the timeline of Sione speaking out the life hack for the first time, is accompanied by a video, demonstrating what the life hack actually is, is playing on top of the audio recording. ] <br><br>

This then proceeds in Sione reading the second life hack out loud with the same sort of style where the video is on top of the audio recording, demonstrating the life hack that is being said out loud. <br><br>

Sione will then say, hmm, nah I don’t really want to do that, implying that these demonstration videos haven’t been carried out yet and were just an idea from his head of what could’ve happened if he were to truly pursue the life hack. [ But in this reality, the life hack was just meant to show footage to the audience member in a sort of humorous but serious way ] <br><br>

[ Next morning has come, and it’s Assignment day. Sione still hasn’t done anything ]<br><br>

Genie will then come in and greet Sione, saying that Sione had failed in his timeline, and the Genie has come back in time to redeem Sione, so Genie then gives Sione the recording device that is used to pass the Multimedia assignment.<br><br>

 [ This video recording device is much better than the device that Sione was originally ‘thinking’ of recording the life hack videos, Now Sione can actually collect some ‘real’ HD footage ]<br><br>

[ Now Sione is annotating the life hack in real life, but this time – with a better recording device ]<br><br>

[ Life hack #1 – Clean your room in the morning ! ]<br><br>

 [ Life hack #2 – Spins off the life hack #1, why cleaning the mess is important! ]<br><br>

    Have shots of Sione cleaning the room<br><br>
    While an audio layer underneath is describing the life hack.<br><br>
    Have a shot where everything is within reach, to show to the audience the power of knowing where each item is!<br><br>

Now Sione is ready to hand his assignment in!<br><br>

With minutes to spare!<br><br>

<h2>Script</h2>
<p>Sione: “Hey guys! Catch ya later!”<br>
Sione walks in the door by turning the key<br>
Sione walks down the hallway to his computer lab<br>
Sione sits down and starts typing<br>
<b>[Have close up of fingers typing with an emphasis on the typing sound]</b><br>
Sione scrolls down his assignment.pdf document<br>
<b>[Camera Zooms in on Assignment Due Date]</b><br>
Sione makes solid expression of concern<br>
Sione: “Due … *stutters on his speech* .. 20th, * still stuttering * “September”<br>
Sione: “But today is, the 19th”<br>
<b>[Have close up of fingers typing with an emphasis on the typing sound]</b> x5 speed<br>
Sione: “Maybe I could do this…”<br>
Sione: “Or maybe I could do this…”<br>
Sione: “Mm nah, that doesn’t really appeal, how about this one!”<br>
<b>[Assignment Day Arrives]</b><br>
Sione is playing World of Warcraft until he realises the time.<br>
Sione: “It’s Assignment Day!”<br>
Sione: “I really need to start my assignment but I don’t have the tools required!”<br>
<b>[Genie appears in the form of a blue eyed person with flames surrounding him]</b><br>
Sione: “Who are you?”<br>
Genie: “It doesn’t matter who I am, what is important is that you failed your multimedia assignment in my timeline. I have come to this timeline to help you succeed!”<br>
Sione:” Um okay?”<br>
<b>[Genie hands Sione an S10+ and disperses]</b><br>
Sione:” Thanks!”<br>
Sione is now uplifted!<br>
Sione: “Now I can do my assignment!”<br>
Sione: “Looks around the room, still having no idea of what he should record a life hack video about”<br>
Sione: “I know! I can video myself finding things to do around the house that would make me feel better!”<br>
Sione then exits the room, and then enters his bedroom with a staunch look on his face as he pans looking around at the mess.<br>
Sione gets in Life Hack Video mode<br>
Sione: “Have you ever not had enough time to make your bed in the morning!”<br>
Sione: “I bet you will also have not enough time to do other things during the day to make your life valuable!”<br>
Sione: “Start by making your bed in the morning, and do all your chores before you do anything else! Because this sort of structure means you’re planning in advance allowing you to fit in everything between a certain amount of time!”<br>
<b>[Camera is now taking a video of the cleaned bedroom]</b><br>
Sione: “Take a look at the difference!”<br>
Sione: “Now you can go to sleep, in a nice bed!<br>
* <b>[Unexpected simulated recording of an actual event]</b><br>
* Soft voice over: “You can also make someone else’s day”<br>
Sione: “Okay bedroom done”<br>
Sione walks towards the next room<br>
Sione has spot another thing that he could do to improve the room!<br>
* Video plays while soft voice over describes why Sione is cleaning.<br>
Voice over dude ( Sione ): “Having an item disappear on you is upsetting, having multiple items in the wrong place, or a place where you will lose track of it, is even worse! It is important to tidy up your workplace, so you know where everything is at all times! I’m talking about you, red pen, blue pen”<br>

Sione: “Now I can finish my assignment”<br>
