<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi I'm Sione Laiva'a Manulea, & welcome to my Multimedia Development portfolio. In this website I will tell you how this website was made! (I used Bootstrap, CSS and I Googled things I didn't know). But the real driving force behind this website were my ideas, and why I used Bootstrap to overcome some of the obstacles that stood between me and my end goals.</p>
<h3>Sources:</h3>
<p>The navbar, I found <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/navbar/">here.</a>
The zoom in picture effect I got <a href="http://www.corelangs.com/css/box/zoom.html">here.</a>
The fixed footer with transparency was inspired from this <a href="https://onepagelove.com/tag/fixed-footer">website.</a>
The fixed footer hover effect I got from <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/ANKwQ/5/">here.</a>
And the embeded responsive YouTube video, I got from this <a href="https://embedresponsively.com/">website.</a>
<h3>Why I chose Bootstrap</h3>
<p>I chose Bootstrap over Jekyll because it gave me complete freedom, with what things did what, and where things went where, and I could start from scratch, which gave this sense of independence, like I was doing something right.</p>

<p>Using Bootstrap, I quickly found the ease of use for setting things up. I used div tags to section my homepage in to 3 grids. Navigation bar, main content, and footer, and then I just entered the content between each corresponding div tag. This layout was planned on a piece of paper that I wanted 3 divisions on my page. The divs tags were just something I knew that would do just what I wanted, then I'd be able to give each div tag its own specialized class names to give the div tags each sense of it's own purpose. </p>

<h3>Colour choices and the footer</h3>
<p>I chose a SkyBlue colour for the header / navigation bar, because the picture I chose to sit underneath the navigation bar contained a sky at the top. I thought, now I should change the main content background colour to a sandy colour, this would really complement the SkyBlue colour in the navigation bar. So I did. SkyBlue at the top with Sand Dunes underneath. The next mission was to place a fixed footer underneath the content of the page, and give it the text 'Created by Sione Manulea'. It sounded good, but I soon discovered the background on the footer was too overpowering, and you couldn't see underneath the content underneath the footer, plus it took up like 10% of the page, which was no good! I didn't want that. So I simply gave the div background colour a transparency colour that would allow users to preview the content behind the footer. Phew, now it looks good! A simple fixed transparent footer, with "Created by Sione Manulea". But I still wasn't overly pleased with it. Searching up some websites of fixed footers, I came across this <a href="http://citylights.xyz/">gem.</a> It was just what I needed! A hover over effect. Turning a love heart in to the creator's name. I instantly searched Google to imitate a similar style so I can apply it to my home page! Success. A love heart, with a hover over effect, that when hovered, reveals who created this website! :)</p>
<p>

<h3>Site content</h3>

<p>There are five main categories of content for my Multimedia work.</p>

<p>These categories include: lab designs, project designs, assignments, and assessments.</p>

<h2>Featured Work</h2>
<p>This video was a test for the real video assignment. This video was created using the DaVinci Resolve software.</p>
